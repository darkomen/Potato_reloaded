# Summary

This is a quick remix of the E3D Titan fan holder by Gyrobot (<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1310161">original design</a>). I loved the rear mount design that allowed easy access to the nozzle. However by having the fan rear mounted I was limited to printing objects at 160mm tall to avoid having the fan holder hit the frame. (I have a RepRap Prusa i3)

I decided to front mount the fan holder using two mounting points of the E3D Titan extruder using two M3x35mm screws and washers. The radial fan is held with m3x20mm screws with nuts and washers. This allows the x-carriage to reach the full 200mm height for those tall prints.

A dual radial fan set up could work if used in conjunction with the original rear mount holder.

Downsides: Makes removing/changing filament slightly more awkward. The idler force indicator is covered by the mount - fixable.
